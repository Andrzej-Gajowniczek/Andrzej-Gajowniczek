🌱 Currently, I am studying g0-pixel, go-termbox, and a few Go libraries focused on message brokers communication (MOM). My aim is to release my own terminal-based library for drawing on the Linux console or displaying a welcoming message graphically after a successful SSH login.

💞️ I'm actively engaged in several side-projects leveraging xterm and the console as a block graphics display. I have achieved the capability to display 137 mixed colors using 16 terminal colors for rendering pictures in a multiuser-target environment on Linux.
